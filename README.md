Privacy Policy for Pythia
Last Updated: 9/25/2023
Welcome to Pythia! This privacy policy aims to inform you about how we treat and protect your data.

1. Information We Collect
We do not collect any personal information from our users. The app's primary function is to send user input to the ChatGPT API along with randomly drawn Tarot cards to aid in generating Tarot readings, and to allow users to save these readings for future review.

2. How We Use Your Information
Generating Tarot Readings: When you request a Tarot reading, your query is sent to the ChatGPT API, which processes your request and returns the result. This query is anonymized and is not linked to your identity.

Saved Readings: If you choose to save a reading for later review, this data is stored locally on your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

3. Data Sharing
We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to third parties, as we do not collect any personal data from our users.

4. Data Security
Although we do not collect personal information, we value your trust in using our app. We strive to use acceptable means to protect any data that the app processes, such as your saved readings stored locally on your device.

5. Children's Privacy
Our app is not intended for users under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
